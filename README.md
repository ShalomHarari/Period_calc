# Period_calculator
Medical calculator of safe post ovulation period. 
Our aim was to know, with the help of blood levels of hormones, if a woman is in a period in which she cannot get pregnant. 
For finding this safe period - we integrated in a biological score four hormones levels.
The score is able to determine with precision if there is no chance for pregnancy.
